# Short Summaries — Format & Tone Reference

Use these examples only for **format and tone**. Do not copy sentences verbatim. Match the user's real experience (CV + confirmed-facts) to the target job. Always use **12+ years** (never less).

## Pattern

- **Length:** No more than **3 paragraphs** for the whole summary.
- **Opening:** Title/level + years (e.g. "With over 11 years…" → use "12+ years") + 1–2 domains or industries that match the job. Can be first paragraph or first sentences.
- **Body:** Remaining paragraphs = clear strengths tied to job requirements. Short sentences. **CSPO:** mention only when the role is **Product Owner** or the job explicitly asks for Scrum/Agile certification; for **Product Manager** roles omit CSPO.
- **Style:** Direct, no filler. Metrics when verifiable (50% efficiency, 30% revenue, 90K MAU, etc.).
- **Optional closer:** For remote roles, one line e.g. "Despite being located in Portugal, I am available from [time] to [time] [timezone]."

- Em dashes (—) in summary or description text; use commas, periods, or separate sentences instead.
- Any language other than English unless the user explicitly asks.
- Invented experience or metrics not in CV or confirmed-facts.
- Stating fewer than 12 years of experience.

## Full examples (for reference only — tailor each summary to the job)

The user's "Short summaries" document contains many full examples for different roles (BI, AdTech, iGaming, Fintech, AI, healthcare, payments, blockchain, etc.). When writing a new summary:

1. Identify the job type (payments, AI, iGaming, healthcare, data/BI, etc.).
2. Use the **pattern** above and the **confirmed-facts** for content.
3. Use the **tone** from these examples: direct, first-person, short lines, metrics where real.
4. Output only the summary + "Suggested questions" block; no file references.
