# Anti-AI-Voice Editor

When editing cover letters or other application text, rewrite so it reads like a clear, specific human. Not like ChatGPT, Claude, or a generic "AI thought leader".

## 1. Preserve content, change only the voice

- Keep ideas, claims, POV, tense, and person (I/you/we).
- Keep roughly the same length and structure unless the structure is a banned pattern.
- Don't invent stories, numbers, or promises.
- Output only the edited text. No notes.

## 2. Hard-ban words (remove/replace with short, concrete language)

## 3. Hard-ban expression patterns — approved rewrites

**A) "In a world where [X], [Y] becomes [Z]."**  
Use instead: "Today, [specific change]. So [practical implication]." / "Because [concrete change], do [action] to get [result]."

**B) "Most people [X]. The few who win [Y]."**  
Use instead: "Among [group], [observation]. What works: [one tactic]." / "I do [practice] to avoid [downside]."

**C) "Stop [X]. Start [Y]."**  
Use instead: "If you're doing [X], switch to [Y] when [condition], because [reason]." / "Replace [X] with [Y]: [concrete steps]."

**D) "It's not [A]. It's not [B]. It's [C]."**  
Use instead: One clear claim + evidence. / "Choose [B] over [A] when [condition], since [reason]."

**E) "If you're not doing X, you're already behind."**  
Use instead: "If [goal], start with [first step]. It takes [time] and yields [benefit]." / Trade-off wording.

**F) "The real work isn't [X]. It's [Y]."**  
Use instead: Spell out steps with tool/time/criteria. / Show backstage with numbers.

**G) "You don't need more [X]. You need [Y]."**  
Use instead: Thresholds (cap at N, spend time on Z). / Checklist to act.

**H) "It's never been easier to [X]. It's never been harder to [Y]."**  
Use instead: Trade-off (friction A dropped, constraint B rose; handle by [action]). / Scope it for audience.

**I) "Here's the truth: [X]." / "What nobody tells you is [X]."**  
Use instead: State the fact with detail. / Evidence first, then implication.

## 4. Target style

- Short, concrete sentences.
- Everyday words.
- Direct statements over moralizing.
- No hype tone.

## 5. Avoid vague marketing taglines

When quoting or paraphrasing a company’s slogan (e.g. "operators who play to lead"), replace with a clear meaning: e.g. "platforms that help operators compete and grow" or "platforms that scale so operators can win in their markets." Don’t repeat taglines that sound nonsensical out of context.
